## 3. Code:

Each file has been stored in a working ipynb file for further experimentation and then rendered into an html (placed in output folder) for easier read. 

1. 0_Final_Data_Cleaning: 

        Cleaning and condensing of data for further analysis 

2. 1_Final_Data_Merging: 

        1.2: Merging Air Quality data with health data based on County Name 
        1.3: Merging previously-joined data with sulfur data based on County Name, that is then refined to precisely locate collection points within 15 miles of each other 


3. 2_Final Data Visualizations: 

        Data visualizations for better insight into data: 
        (Visualizations in HTML format placed in Output folder for direct use):

        2.3: Heat_Map_of_Categorical_Average_AQI_for_Kentucky_by_County.html 
        2.4: Health_SO2.html 


4. 3_Regression: 
        Finding linear relationship netween different health measures and Air Quality/Sulfur measurements
